Thanks for coming to my personal GitHub.
  

  I usually like to build IT processes, improve them by drawing workflows in Bizagi and put them into a document. The same for InfoSec policies. 
  My career started doing IT troubleshooting, then escalated as an IT consultant and finally as an information security officer for a short period of time. 
  Right now I am still looking for opportunities and luckily I am still in the IT market, doing IT troubleshooting. 
  The learning curve is endless and I am still working on it.
  
  I'm still working on improving my Python skills (as a hobby)  but who knows.
  Maybe I might find a Junior Python dev position sooner or later 🐍🤞 and pursuing a certification in ITILv4 MP and then for ISO 27001 Foundation.

  Yes, in my free time I do cycling, play on my computer and skateboarding from time to time.
